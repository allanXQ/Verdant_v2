#implement filter,sort, pagination
sellorder and buy order
#sellOrder and buyOrder are too similar. Create a single function to handle both
#update components using withdrawal schema and withdrawal fees to include new changes to models(widthrawal mode, userId-withdrawal-fees)
#prevent users from buying or selling to themselves
#extract create id to its own util function

#check if we can get buyer or seller id based on the orderId and prevent sending of these ids when creating buy or sell limit order

#optimize getTrades querying style to be DRY
#buyOrder,sellOrder validation schemas. amount should be greater than 0
